\chapter{\label{cha:Preface}Preface}

First of all, I would like to thank Dr. Burcu Ozkan, Dr. Ori Lahav, and Dr. Michalis Kokologiannakis, who have provided me with extensive guidance. Without their supervision and support, I would not have been able to conduct this research project. It has been a great honor to learn from and work with such outstanding individuals. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Prof. Arie van Deursen and Dr. Jeremie Decouchant for their invaluable support to this thesis project.

I am grateful for my two years as an MSc student at TU Delft. I would like to thank the professors and teaching assistants for providing incredible lectures and learning materials. I understand that "it takes ten minutes of class time for every ten hours of preparation." I would also like to thank Dr. Jonas Thies for supervising my research internship, which was a truly memorable experience. I am thankful to the EEMCS faculty for offering such a supportive platform with so many kind people and fascinating research opportunities.

I would like to thank my family for their constant support, both mentally and financially. I wish them a joyful and fulfilling life. I also want to thank my friends; it has been a great fortune to have them with me throughout this journey.

Last but not least, knowing oneself is as difficult as knowing others. Learning to get along with and befriend myself has always been an important lesson. "Be the water clear, it can wash my tassels; be the water muddy, it can wash my feet." I hope I never stop exploring this wonderful world.
